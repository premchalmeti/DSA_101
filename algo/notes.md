## Algorithms:
- An algorithm is a procedure having well defined steps for solving a perticular problem. 
- The data stored in the DS is manipulated by using different algorithms.

### Types:

1. Greedy:
    - Taking decision that appears best at moment.
    - Not always results in optimal solution
    - examples where it produce optimal result is,
        1. Dijkstra's single source shortest path
        2. Prim's algo for MST
        3. krushkal's algo for MST
        4. Huffman algorithm

2. Divide and conquer:
    - divide problem into smaller problems and solve
    - combine solutions into final solution
    - examples,
        1. merge sort
        2. quick sort
        3. binary search

3. Backtracking:
    - try a decision, check if it leads to a solution if it doesn't undo operation and check
    - trial and error
    - example:
        - N-queen problem
        - permutations

4. Randomized algo:
    - random nos used to make decisions
    - example:
        - quick sort with random pivot
