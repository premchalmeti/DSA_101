## Data:
- Raw collection of bits

### Information:
- Data if arranged in systematic way gets meaningful information


### Abstract Data Type (ADT):
- Built on top of built in data types
- Hides internal complexity
- Is like a black box; logical view of the data
- Defines the operations to be performed


### Data structure:
- Implementation of the ADT
- Is concrete view; defines how the data to be stored
