## DS & Algorithms

This repository contains the python implementation of standard Data Structures, algorithms and programming problems (hackerrank, codewars).

----

- To make the programs inside `ds/` to work properly. 
- Inside the `ds/.env`, set the absolute path of `ds/`


        .env
        export DSPATH=.../ds/

    This environment variable is added as `PYTHONPATH` while importing the data structures.


- If your terminal doesn't support auto-loading of `.env` file then append the code inside [gist](https://gist.github.com/premchalmeti/19efc522fc96c47c5344c83dd6853951) inside your `.bashrc`. This will enable the auto-load of .env.
